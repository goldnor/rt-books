## A Data Structure to Describe Ray-Object Intersections

The `hit_record` is to avoid a bunch of arguments so we can stuff whatever info we want in there. You can use arguments instead of an encapsulated type, itâ€™s just a matter of taste. Hittables and materials need to be able to reference the other's type in code so there is some circularity of the references. In C++ we add the line class material; to tell the compiler that material is a class that will be defined later. Since we're just specifying a pointer to the class, the compiler doesn't need to know the details of the class, solving the circular reference issue. [^102a]
[^102a]: In Rust traits needs to be imported using the `use` keyword. Circular references are not a problem in Rust, since the `use` keyword does *not* simply copy the header file in comparison to the C++ `include` macro.

[^102b]: `HitRecord` can no longer derive `Default` since `Rc<dyn Material>` can not implement `Default`. Instead, the default material is set to a Lambertian.


`hit_record` is just a way to stuff a bunch of arguments into a class so we can send them as a group. When a ray hits a surface (a particular sphere for example), the material pointer in the `hit_record` will be set to point at the material pointer the sphere was given when it was set up in `main()` when we start. When the `ray_color()` routine gets the `hit_record` it can call member functions of the material pointer to find out what ray, if any, is scattered.

To achieve this, `hit_record` needs to be told the material that is assigned to the sphere.
