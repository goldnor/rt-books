## Fuzzy Reflection

We can also randomize the reflected direction by using a small sphere and choosing a new endpoint for the ray. We'll use a random point from the surface of a sphere centered on the original endpoint, scaled by the fuzz factor.

The bigger the fuzz sphere, the fuzzier the reflections will be. This suggests adding a fuzziness parameter that is just the radius of the sphere (so zero is no perturbation). The catch is that for big spheres or grazing rays, we may scatter below the surface. We can just have the surface absorb those.

Also note that in order for the fuzz sphere to make sense, it needs to be consistently scaled compared to the reflection vector, which can vary in length arbitrarily. To address this, we need to normalize the reflected ray.

We can try that out by adding fuzziness 0.3 and 1.0 to the metals:

```
